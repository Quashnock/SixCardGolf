This is my first project using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a functional application and 
was submitted for the NWHacks 2024 Hackathon in Vancouver. This app simulates a single player version of the card 
game Six Card Golf, where the goal is to get the least amount of points by matching cards in columns to cancel 
their value. Card logic and placement was largely done using beginner Dom Manipulation and Local Storage.

Note: Not fully responsive, may not display properly on mobile devices.
